## 分子筛内嵌金属或合金团簇复合催化剂的合成与性能研究(第十九届全国催化学术会议（重庆）2019年)

- 将金属团簇内嵌于分子筛孔道中，可构成一种特殊的复合结构催化剂，其中的金属团簇被分子筛骨架所包围（surrouding），具有不同于传统负载型（supporting）催化剂的结构。
- 尽管分子筛是研究多年的传统材料，但是到目前为止，对其晶内电场究竟如何影响孔道中金属团簇的催化性质以 及二者之间的协同对催化反应的影响等并没有一个系统的认识。
- 与单金属团簇相比,将双金属团簇内嵌于分子筛孔道所构成的催化剂将会具有更加丰富的性质，但此种材料迄今 未见报道。
- 工作主要包括:
  （1）以 X 分子筛内嵌铂团簇为模型催化剂，发现通过改变分子筛内部的平衡阳离子去改变分子筛晶内电场可以逐步调节分子筛孔中铂团簇的费米能级和 d 带中心，最终调控该催化剂对一系列加氢反应的催化活性。
  （2）在分子筛孔道中合成双金属团簇的难度很大，目前尚无报道。我们开发了一种“催化沉积”法可以高效合成出铂铁（钴）合金团簇内嵌于 X 分子筛的复合材料，不同于传统负载型催化剂，该催化剂对邻氯硝基苯加氢反应呈现远高于目前文献报导的最优结果的TOF
  值。而且，基于此类催化剂的特殊结构，还发现一种特殊的催化阈值行为，在此阈值附近，温度或压力的微小变化可带来催化活性的巨大变化。
  （3）基于以上对分子筛内嵌金属或合金团簇复合催化剂的研究所认识到的规律，我们针对工业上苯酚加氢制环己酮和环己烷选择氧化制环己酮这两个重要反应设计了两种催化剂，均取得了非常优异的催化效果。表明分子筛与金属团簇的协同配合可以创造独特的催化
  性能，反应了催化反应中心外围组织的重要性.

## 在十六烷基磷酸稳定的 O/W 型乳液中完全催化甲苯氧化成苯甲醛混合氧化物纳米颗粒[(DOI: S1872-2067(19)63417-0,2020年)](Literature - Analysis instrument collation#s1872-20671963417-0)

-  For the green oxidation of toluene by O2 exclusively to benzaldehyde, a highly efficient catalytic system was explored in our [previous work](Reference.md#previous-work) using a biphasic system with HDPA-FeOx nanoparticles locating themselves at the interface of toluene and water to stabilize the O/W emulsion, i.e, Pickering emulsion .[Resasco](Reference.md#resasco-23-25) et al. have made the first use of [Pickering emulsions](Reference.md#pickering-emulsion) for the biphasic hydrodeoxygenation and condensation in biomass refining as well as other reactions.
- Considering the solubility of the reactants, the water has a significant effect on the transportation of O2 from gas phase to the liquid phase as well as the products from the surface of the catalyst to the liquid phase (Figs. 1(a), 1(b), and 1(c)). Fig. 1(d) depicts the real laser confocal fluorescence photograph of the reaction mixture **_with small amount of rhodamine B as fluorescence dye adsorbed on the catalyst, confirming the O/W Pickering emulsion of the reactive system._** Under such conditions, the surface-bonded HDPAs boost the access of the nonpolar toluene as well as the seceding of the relatively polar product, i.e., benzaldehyde, from the nonpolar surface to the polar environment, constituting a complete catalytic cycle of high performance.

## 具有高能量外表面的纳米管状伽马氧化铝：合成与高性能催化[(ACS Catal.2017, 7, 4083-4092)](Literature - Analysis instrument collation#4083-4092)

- The structural conversion of boehmite to [γ-alumina](Reference.md#alumina) has been thoroughly investigated in the past decades.47,48 Considering the Digne et al.’s model, the energies of typical planes of boehmite, i.e., (010), (001), (100) and (101), are calculated by DFT methods under various conditions and the results are listed in Table 1. The optimized structures after acetic acid adsorbed on different γ-AlOOH surfaces are summarized in Figure 1. In calculation, acetic acid is used as [protection reagent](Reference.md#protecting-group). The results show clearly the protection of carboxylic acid adsorption on (101) plane of boehmite, by which the surface energy of (101) plane turns to the lowest one among the main four planes of low miller indexes. This means that the (101) plane of boehmite will gradually show up during the hydrothermal treatment of boehmite nanoparticles in assembly.
- In our experimental preparation, the boehmite colloidal particulates (obtained from Zhejiang Yuda Chemical Co., Ltd, China) are prepared from the hydrolysis of isopropanol aluminum under controlled conditions, the suspension pH of this boehmite colloidal is about 4. The BET surface of the boehmite colloidal particulates (dried at 353 K) is ~183 m2/g. The [XRD](CharacterizationTechniques.md#xrd) pattern of the dried boehmite colloidal particulates (Figure S1) shows that all the diffraction peaks are indexed to γ-AlOOH (JCPDS, 21-1307). The TEM image (Figure 2a) shows that the boehmite colloidal particulates are consist of very tiny colloidal boehmite particles in the size of 2~3 nm (right inset of Figure 2a). These nanoparticles are found positively charged with very high Zeta potential (left inset of Figure 2a). By co-assembly with micelles of anionic surfactant (oleic acid, and ammonia or sodium hydroxide are used as base to adjust pH values of the solution) under hydrothermal conditions at 453 K for 72 h, nanotubular products are obtained with the average lengths and diameters of about 90.5 nm and 6.6 nm respectively (Figure 2b). As a result of DFT calculation, the adsorption of carboxyl acid offers large adsorption energy and stabilizes the (101) plane of boehmite. The oleic acid behaves as a bifunctional additive. The positively charged AlOOH particles assembled with the negatively charged micelles of oleic acid and, at the same time, some of the carboxyl head of oleic acid adsorbed on the AlOOH to protect the (101) planes stay behind the hydrothermal treatment. The inner diameters of the nanotubular products are mostly in several nanometers (Figure 2b). It appears that the alumina colloidal nanoparticles undergo a process of amalgamation within the nanotube walls, giving rise to compact structure during hydrothermal treatment. All the X-ray diffraction peaks of the sample (inset of Figure 2b) are indexed to γ-AlOOH (JCPDS, 21-1307). By heating the sample at high temperatures, the γ-AlOOH transforms to γ-alumina, reserving the morphology of nanotubes through dehydration. The TEM image of a sample after calcination at 823 K (Figure 2c) show that the nanotubular morphology is remained and the average length and diameters of the as-prepared γ-alumina nanotube are about 68 nm and 6 nm respectively. The BET surface area of the as-prepared γ-alumina nanotube is ~140 m2/g. The XRD pattern of the calcined sample (inset of Figure 2c) shows that all the diffraction peaks are indexed to γ-alumina according to Digne et al.’s model.49,50 The highly magnified TEM image of a γ-alumina nanotube is displayed in Figure 2d. The wall of the nanotube is single crystal-like γ-alumina and the lattice fringes of planes with a d-spacing of 0.460 nm, corresponding to {110} planes of γ-alumina, are observed clearly.
