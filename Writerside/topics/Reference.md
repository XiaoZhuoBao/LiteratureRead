## Protecting group

A protecting group or protective group is introduced into a molecule by chemical modification of a functional group to obtain chemoselectivity in a subsequent chemical reaction. It plays an important role in multistep organic synthesis.In many preparations of delicate organic compounds, specific parts of the molecules cannot survive the required reagents or chemical environments. These parts (functional groups) must be protected.  

The difficulties honestly lie in their stability and in selective removal. Apparent problems in synthesis strategies with protecting groups are rarely documented in the academic literature.

The acetal is then called a protecting group for the carbonyl. After the hydride step is complete, aqueous acid removes the acetal, restoring the carbonyl. This step is called deprotection.

- Orthogonal protection:Orthogonal protection is a strategy allowing the specific deprotection of one protective group in a multiply-protected structure.
- Cleavage categorization:
    - Acid-labile protecting groups
      Base-labile protecting groups
      Fluoride-labile protecting groups
      Enzyme-labile protecting groups
      Reduction-labile protecting groups
      Oxidation-labile protecting groups
      Protecting groups cleaved by heavy metal salts or their complexes.
      Photolabile protecting groups
      Double-layered protecting groups
      Various groups are cleaved in acid or base conditions, but the others are more unusual.
- Common protecting groups:
    - Alcohol protecting groups
    - 1,2-Diols
    - Amine protecting groups
    - Carbonyl protecting groups
    - Carboxylic acid protecting groups
    - Alkene
    - Phosphate protecting groups
    - Terminal alkyne protecting groups

## Pickering emulsion

Pickering emulsion is an emulsion that is stabilized by solid particles (for example colloidal silica) which adsorb onto the interface between the water and oil phases.The emulsions' conditions are complex.When oil and water are mixed and small oil droplets are formed and dispersed throughout the water,eventually the droplets will coalesce to decrease the amount of energy in the system. However, if solid particles are added to the mixture, they will bind to the surface of the interface and prevent the droplets from coalescing, making the emulsion more stable.The particle’s contact angle to the surface of the droplet is a characteristic of the hydrophobicity of the particle.
